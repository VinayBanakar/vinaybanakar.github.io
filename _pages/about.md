<!-- <h3><strong>Hello!</strong></h3> -->
I am Vinay, a PhD student in the [Computer Sciences Department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at [The University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and a Student Researcher at [Google Systems Research Group](https://techsysinfra.google/research/). At UW-Madison, I am part of [The ADvanced Systems Laboratory](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by Prof. [Andrea Arpacı-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/){:target="\_blank"} and Prof. [Remzi Arpacı-Dusseau](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interest is **computer systems**: Byte-Addressable Storage, distributed storage systems, and systems for ML. My current focus is on exploring new Data-Intensive computing paradigms for Byte-Addressable Storage.

Previously, I was a Research Collaborator at the [Microsoft Gray Systems Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/gray-systems-lab/), a Senior Systems Engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise RnD Labs, and a remote Research Fellow at [Systems and Storage Lab](https://utsaslab.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 

<!-- I have had the pleasure collaborating with [Dr. Kimberly Keeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Keeton){:target="\_blank"} [[Gen-Z persistent fabric-attached memory](http://openfam.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}], [Prof. Supreeth Shastri](https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~sshastri/){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Arun Kumar](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~arunkk/){:target="\_blank"} [[GDPRBench](https://www.gdprbench.org/){:target="\_blank"}]. -->


<!-- data privacy and large scale resource (compute, network and storage) orchestration in datacenters. Especially, my recent work focuses on designing and building benchmarks for persistent fabric attached memory architecture, determining the impact of privacy regulations on storage system’s design and performance by building a benchmarking tool, and finally designing and implementing intent driven hardware provisioning and placement algorithms. -->
